                    <strong>Mesenchymal Stem Cells (MSCs):</strong> <br>
                    What are they? These are special types of cells found in your body that can develop into different types of tissues, like bone, cartilage, and fat. They have the potential to help in healing injuries or regenerating damaged tissues.

                    <strong>Stem Cell Lines: </strong><br>
                    What are they? Stem cell lines are groups of stem cells that have been grown in a lab for a long time. These cells can keep dividing and are used by scientists to study how cells work and how they can be used in medicine.

                    <strong>High Throughput Screening (HTS):</strong>
                    <br>
                    What is it? Imagine trying to find the best ingredient in a recipe by testing thousands of different combinations quickly. HTS is a lab process that allows scientists to test a large number of different samples or conditions all at once, speeding up the research.

                Summary
            </h2>
            <p>
                This title refers to a scientific process where researchers use advanced computer techniques (deep learning) to quickly test and study many different samples of a specific type of stem cells (mesenchymal stem cells). The goal is to efficiently find out how these cells behave, which could help in developing new medical treatments.
